NOTES ON THE WOS SEARCH

Raw output is over 40K.  So we filtered by philosophy, since "phenomenology" is used in other fields in other senses.  Also filtred by document type article, to filter out reviews, editorials, book chapters in books.  These other sources are not as well indexed.

Articles in all languages were searched, even though the actual search phrase was "Phenomenology" (case insensitive) in the Topics field.

Topic is based on 1) The Title of the article, review,  etc. 2) The Abstract 3) The Keywords and Keywords Plus fields.  For indexing reasons all entries in WOS have at least the abstract in english.  See
